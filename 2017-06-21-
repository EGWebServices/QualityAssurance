![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/YUNCToxGB4sZ9vahLY8Nbw_img_0.png)

## Adding a text Attachment to a Comment Step

Given that I am in the Edit Comment Step form

When I enter text into the content field

And enter text into the text attachment field

And click "Save"

Then I am taken back to the activity's dashboard

And the system responds, "Path step has been saved."

## Completing the comment step with a text attachment

### Previewing the Step

When I complete the step

Then the attached text appears

### Completing the step inside the activity

When I complete the step

Then the attached text appears on the right hand side of the screen
